I do not think that a democracy is the best political structure, I think it's the least easy to corrupt. Twitter et. al. has done a wonderful job of making news creation public and non-professional. It's difficult to moderate or to stop and once people accept it as the norm it will continue to change things for the better.<br /><br />People have more power to reach the world now. The web managed, by bringing everyone onto one place, to form groups; which is a good thing in this case. You might expect everyone to become homogenised by the internet, we all have access to the same global media. But what happened is far greater; you can find groups of people with the same interests as you.<br /><br />Someone who wants to discuss, for no other reason than that it interests them, the details of making a better shoe, voting system, teaching method. You find people with a love of almost everything.<br /><br />Three things I looked up recently:<br /><ol><li>The speed of gravity (wave propagation)</li><li>New ways to tie shoelaces</li><li>Backpacking without carrying much<br /></li></ol>Not only did I find these things (and more) but there was more than one website that told me more than I wanted to know about each.

<H1 >Goal
Setting and Goal Achievement</H1>
<P >The reason people succeed is well-focused,
regular, effort.</P>
<P >The reason for failure is more often lack of
effort rather than the direction of the effort. For example, more
people put on weight because they couldn't stick to their diet than
those that chose a diet that wouldn't have caused weight loss.</P>
<H2 >1. How the Brain Decides what Task you Will
Perform</H2>
<P >You subconscious decides on your motivation for a
task, but you can consciously choose to use your self-control and not
do the easiest task. For example, my subconscious is saying that
watching TV requires the least motivation but I have chosen to use up
some of my self-control and write this article instead.</P>
<P >I'm going to discuss a few tactics to reduce the
self-control required to complete a task (such as setting up a
trigger) as well as ways of making your subconscious disfavour your
distractions (for example by removing the plug from your TV).</P>
<H3 >1.1 Motivation</H3>
<P >A good guideline for the motivation that your
subconscious gives you for a task is given in the equation below.</P>
<P >
  <IMG SRC="http://kerspoon.com/img/2013-goals/procrastination-equation.png" WIDTH=548 HEIGHT=99>
  <BR CLEAR=LEFT>
    The
Expectancy and Value can be thought of in terms of gambling. The
Value is how much you get paid if you win and the Expectancy is the
probability of winning. The Value of a task changes constantly as it
is how much you value completing the task at any given moment. Delay
is the amount of time before you will get the pay-off. For writing an
essay it is likely to be after the entire thing is written, watching
TV is an almost instant hit. Impulsiveness is a more complex part
which is covered in Piers Steel's &ldquo;Procrastination&rdquo;.</P>
<P >If you are struggling to put effort in to a task
then it is probably because your motivation for it is lower than its
alternatives. For example, there are many things I could do at the
moment: I could get some food, play computer games, go for a walk,
write this essay, etc. and each has a certain level of motivation
based on the above equation. If I make sure I'm not hungry then the
first task is of such low value that it wont be a problem. If I
delete my computer games so I have to find the CD to be able to play
them it increases the delay making that less of an issue.</P>
<P >Every time you get distracted take note of the
task and see why you have a higher motivation for it than what you
should be doing. Then go through each part of the equation in turn to
see if you can reduce the motivation for tasks you don't want to do.</P>
<H2 >1.2 Self Control</H2>
<P >Self-control is the effort you put in to a task to
make sure you do it instead of one with a higher motivation. For
example, getting a snack might have a higher motivation than
continuing with my work but I can use up some self-control to make
sure I keep working.</P>
<P >Self control is like a muscle. Do too much and you
will exhaust it, but if you successfully use it regularly it will get
stronger.</P>
<H2 >2. How to Set goals to increase changes of
success</H2>
<P >Below are three methods to increase the chances of
succeeding at a task. They are based on the ideas in section one.</P>
<OL>
  <LI><P >The first method (triggers and mechanical
  starting points) works because you quickly program your subconscious
  to perform a task at a given time. It means you can sidestep the
  subconscious calculation of motivation until the task has started,
  and starting is often the hardest part.</P>
  <LI><P >The second (mental contrasting) provides you
  with a more accurate guess for the value and expectancy of the task.
  This means you can work out whether you are likely to succeed before
  you have started. It also increases your motivation when doing the
  task.</P>
  <LI><P >The third (prevention or promotion) frames
  the goal so that you get more motivation when you need it most. But
  you have to choose when you need it, there is a tradeoff.</P>
</OL>
<P >It will still take a lot of self control to
achieve worthwhile tasks but by using mechanisms such as this you can
increase you chances.</P>
<H3 >
2.1 Triggers and Mechanical Starting Points</H3>
<P >The key to this method of goal setting is to set
up simple triggers and a mechanical starting point. A trigger is
something to tell you when to start working on your goal, a
mechanical task is one that can be done with no thinking, or at least
without conscious thought. By thinking of your goal in terms of
triggers and starting points you can form a habit much quicker. For
example if you goal is to become more flexible you should convert
this into one with trigger and a mechanical starting point.</P>
<P >The trigger should specify exactly where and when
you start, a good example would be &quot;straight after brushing your
teeth every weekday morning&quot; (this is only a good example if you
already have the habit of brushing your teeth every morning), a bad
example would be &quot;at 8:15am&quot;, what happens if you wake up a
bit late and are brushing your teeth at that time. A further problem
with purely time based triggers is that you wont be able to tell it
is exactly 8:15 unless you set an alarm and in a lot of cases it is
not practical to have many alarms going off through the day.</P>
<P >A mechanical starting point is something that gets
you started without having to think. Setting your alarm for 10mins
and swinging your leg back and forward would be a good starting point
for the goal of become more flexible. If your goal was to write a
book a good starting point would be to get out your notebook and read
through the last bit of what you wrote last time. A bad starting
point would be to continue writing where you left off last time, that
requires conscious thought.</P>
<P >Some goals do not have a time based trigger at
all, for example &ldquo;not snacking&rdquo; applies all the time. You
still want to form a habit that your subconscious can follow without
having to deplete your self control. In that cause I would suggest
framing the goal in terms of &quot;if ... then ...&quot; e.g. <B>if </B>I
feel the urge to snack <B>then </B>I will eat a few nuts and seeds
and drink a glass of water. For goals like this you can also factor
in the brain taking the easiest option, if you make it a real effort
to get to the snacks you will be less likely to do so.</P>
<H3 >2.2 Mental
Contrasting</H3>
<P >The next key point is to consider alternating
points of view of the goal. You want to be overly pessimistic about
how hard it will be (i.e. think it will be difficult) but optimistic
about your chance of success. The idea is to get to a point where you
think:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE >&quot;This will be hard to achieve but I
know, with a lot of self control and effort I can do it, and it
really will be worth it.&quot;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P >The way to do this is to alternate between
thinking of reasons why the task will be difficult (or why you could
fail) then think of why it is important to you to achieve.</P>
<P >When you are thinking of the difficulties imagine
yourself in a realistic situation where you are likely to give up.
Think up a bad day where you are hungry, annoyed, lonely, and/or
tired (H.A.L.T). After you have put yourself in that mindset imagine
what would tip you over the edge into failing your goal in some way.
By picturing you mental state it will help you have a more realistic
view of you chances for success.</P>
<P >Then imagine that you have already achieved the
goal. Think of the reasons why it helped you or made your life
better. You can also imagine what it would be like to not achieve the
goal. Really think if this would make any difference or not. This
will help you work out how important the goal is to you. It is
important to be brutally honest.</P>
<P >Repeat this cycle two or three times and you
should have a good idea if you are likely to put in the effort when
it counts, and if that effort is worth it. You should need very long
to do this, just make sure you do each part in turn (think first of
the difficulties, then the reasons).</P>
<P >You might realise that when the chips are down and
you are hungry, angry, lonely, tired or just having a bad day you are
likely to give up. If this is the case (remember to be a bit
pessimistic about this) then don&rsquo;t bother working on the goal.
You have already decided that it is not worth the effort. If you
think you cannot succeed when you are planning you will have no hope
when some unexpected challenge pops up.</P>
<P >It is also worth quickly thinking through an
&ldquo;if-then&rdquo; reaction for your sticking points that you have
identified. For example, if you are trying to run every day but you
know some days you feel tired and find it difficult to start. In that
case you could set the response to be &quot;<B>If</B> I ever feel too
tired to start running <B>then </B>I will put my running shoes on and
leave the house whether I actually run or not.&quot; The problem is
likely to be self-control depletion not exhaustion, by getting to the
point of actually running you have lowered the mental effort of
starting.</P>
<H3 >2.3
Prevention or Promotion</H3>
<P >The different ways you can think about a goal
change where you will put effort in to it. You can either have a goal
where you must not fail (prevention) or a goal where you want to
conquer (promotion). The way you phrase your goal can change it from
one to the other and cause you to have more motivation when you need
it. For example lets say you go rock climbing for fun with some
friends, if you are worried that you are holding the group back so
must train harder then your focus is prevention. If you want to beat
everyone else then your focus is promotion.</P>
<P >If you have a prevention focus then you get more
motivation when you are failing but less when you are doing well.
Taking the example of rock climbing, if you had a really bad training
session where you were actually worse than before then you would feel
like you had to train even harder because you really cannot afford to
fail. On the other hand you will put less effort in when succeeding,
after all your goal is simply not to fail and if you are doing great
then you can afford to put in less effort.</P>
<P >If you have a promotion focus you get more
motivation when you are doing well but are likely to give up when
failing. For example if you have had a great training session and
managed to beat someone on a new climb then you will feel elated and
want to do more. Yet if you do badly then you are likely to put less
effort in and hence do even worse and give up. If you were trying to
win but if looks like you can't then why bother to put the effort in.</P>
<P >You can use this to your advantage. Think of
whether you want more motivation when failing or succeeding and frame
your goal accordingly. For any task you can choose promotion or
prevention not both. If you decide you want a promotion goal and
start to fail then you should realise it, feel bad about it and make
a conscious decision to put more effort in.</P>
<H2 >3 Summary</H2>
<P >The subconscious gives you a motivation value for
every thing you could do. You can change the motivation by working
out why your subconscious is choosing distracting things and changing
those factors. By spending a few minutes examining your goals you can
increase the likelihood of achieving them. The three ways discussed
were:</P>
<OL>
  <LI><P >&quot;If-then&quot; triggers,
  </P>
  <LI><P >Mental contrasting,
  </P>
  <LI><P >Changing the wording of the goal to give
  either a prevention or promotion focus.</P>
</OL>
<P >Remember that even with this type of goal setting
you are vulnerable to self-control depletion. Sometimes you have bad
days and on those days it will take a lot of mental effort and a lot
of thinking through why you wanted to achieve the goal to actually
succeed. The check-list below is meant to take the ideas above and
form them into questions to improve the chances of succeeding.</P>
<P >I suggest having a written list of goals somewhere
where you will look at them regularly. For example, a bedside table
where you can look at them morning and night. It depends on your
routine. There is no point in having these triggers if they are not
regularly refreshed in your mind. The best way to do that is to read
them and perform them regularly.</P>

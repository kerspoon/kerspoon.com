Below is a good chunk of an e-mail I sent to <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/">Steve Yegge</a>. It was basically a summary of what programming related things I have been doing and where he thought it was enough to get a job. <br /><br /><hr /><br /><br /><br />First a short list of some of the things I am now doing related to that aim (I'm sure you will recognize some of these from your posts):<br /><br />+ I subscribe to a number of programming blogs<br />+ I use emacs (though I'm still not happy with my configuration)<br />+ I started learning to touch type (in Colemak)<br />+ I'm programming in lots of languages<br />+ I'm trying to optimize the way I work<br />+ I read a bit of wikipedia, stackoverflow, ted.com most days<br />+ I've started Project Euler challenges in python<br />+ I have written a minimal Scheme interpreter in C++ &amp; Digital Mars D<br />+ I have written very simple scripts in BASH/grep/find/cat/sed<br />+ I use Linux (in the lab), Windows (at home) and Mac OS (at work)<br />+ I have read SICP, GEB, Design Patterns, The Pragmatic Programmer<br /><br />About me (if you're actually interested)<br />========<br /><br />I am a UK PhD student currently studying Electrical Power Systems, which involves a lot of work on artificial intelligence. Before that I did a BEng in Electrical Engineering involving writing a Genetic Algorithm to optimize settings on a controller for a virtual mag-lev train. I wrote the GA, the integration algorithm, the simulator and the GUI in C++.<br /><br />Started programming in Macromedia Director Lingo, moved on to VB/VBA in school, taught myself HTML, CSS and a little bit of PHP so I could design a couple of websites. Took an online course in Game Programming that taught me C++ &amp; DirectX/Win32 API. At University I had courses on Unix &amp; C, Java, Matlab, and PIC programming in assembly. I would only really say I am comfortable writing C++ and python, I can read and understand the others, not sure why but I really dislike Java. I haven't been taught much computer science but I think my math is good.<br /><br />My Aims<br />========<br /><br />+ Learn a pure functional language<br />+ Learn a bit of Forth<br />+ Learn a more of Python<br />+ Read a book on:<br />    - Compliers<br />    - Algorithms<br />    - Regular Expressions<br />    - Mathematics for Programmers<br />+ Read the following:<br />    - Programming Language Pragmatics by Michael L. Scott<br />    - Hacker's Delight by Henry S. Warren<br />    - Refactoring by Martin Fowler<br />+ Improve my scheme interpreter by:<br />    - Implementing macros<br />    - Implementing call/cc (then hopefully understand it better)<br />    - Re-writing in python<br />+ Learn how to use threads<br /><br />The Questions<br />========<br /><br />1. I'm struggling to learn a different keyboard layout, do you think it's really worth it?<br /><br />2. As I haven't done a CS degree is there any thing I really need to know that I haven't covered?<br /><br />3. Out of my aims which do you think are more important, are there any pointless ones, or ones you would like to add?<br /><br />4. Do you think that if I achieved my aims I would be good enough to be hired?<br /><br />5. Is there resources other than Project Euler that will give me tasks to make me learn a language better.<br /><br />6. How important is doing the exercises in the book I read? How many do you do when you read a new book?<br /><br />My emacs Annoyance<br />========<br /><br />I found emacs to be like my iPhone; amazing yet annoying. When I got my iPhone I was amazed at all the new things I could do and how easy most tasks were, shortly after that I was annoyed that they hadn't done more, it's not complete.<br /><br />emacs has the potential to be just about the best application ever made but for me the default settings suck. It took days to be able to use (which isn't a problem) but weeks in and I'm still struggling to get things like auto-completion working how I want it to. It's as if you have to live in emacs and hack everything together yourself. Still, I cant go back to any other editor now, emacs is just too good. But I will remain frustrated that all those things that I want to do and I know are possible are going to elude me, unless I take the time to get it working myself.<br /><br />It's like the difference between Firefox and Opera. Firefox gives you a pretty basic web browser with the magic ability to add to it. Opera gives you an advanced web browser out of the box without the ability to add to it. I used to use Opera because the addons for Firefox don't work well with each other and it would take a long time to get it working how I wanted. It's the same with emacs, but there is no equivalent (maybe TextMate).<br /><br /><br />Before this get too long I will end it, thanks for reading up to this point.<br /><br />James Brooks

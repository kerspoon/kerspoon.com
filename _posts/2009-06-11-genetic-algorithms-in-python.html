Following on from before here is some resources for programming GA in python. The top one looks like the easiest to understand and hence is my preferred one.<br /><ul><li><a href="http://code.activestate.com/recipes/199121/">http://code.activestate.com/recipes/199121/</a></li><li><a href="http://www.alextreme.org/projects/python_ai/">http://www.alextreme.org/projects/python_ai/</a></li><li><a href="http://pygp.sourceforge.net/">http://pygp.sourceforge.net/</a></li><li><a href="http://www.freenet.org.nz/python/pygene/">http://www.freenet.org.nz/python/pygene/</a></li></ul>As a side-note here is a list of neural network resources in Python:<br /><a href="http://www.answermysearches.com/four-free-neural-network-libraries-for-python/195/">http://www.answermysearches.com/four-free-neural-network-libraries-for-python/195/</a><br /><br />I'm thinking or reviving one of my old projects; to recreate critters from aijunkie. I have quite a few ideas I would like to add to them once it's up and running.

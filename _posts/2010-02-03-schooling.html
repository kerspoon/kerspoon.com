I think most of what is taught to children is pointless.<br /><br />That said, I think that the fact that they are taught is very important; it teaches them how to learn. Here are the things that I consider vital:<br /><ol><li>Learning (Teaching, Memory)</li><li>Communication (English Language, Presentations)</li><li>Research (Scientific Method)</li></ol><div><div style="margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">That is it, if they come out knowing nothing else these things should be excellent in all&nbsp;pupils. The main aim of education up to 18 years old should be to teach people to learn and think for themselves. They should be able to:</div><ul><li>Critically&nbsp;analyse&nbsp;a&nbsp;newspaper&nbsp;article then&nbsp;teach peers&nbsp;(Check sources. Fact check.&nbsp;Hi-light&nbsp;misleading passages.&nbsp;Decide if the author is biased).</li><li>Perform a literature review on a topic&nbsp;then teach peers.</li><li>Conduct a scientific valid study and&nbsp;then teach peers.</li><li>(Teach peers using a mix of verbal presentations, written literature and one-to-one tuition)</li></ul><div>The next things are much easier learn at a young age:</div></div><ol><li>Sport, Nutrition &amp; Health</li><li>Maths</li><li>Foreign&nbsp;Languages</li><li>Using a Computer</li></ol>These should be taught. In fact I think that most of these things can be brought in to every bit of schooling if done&nbsp;correctly. If that is done then we should have a lot of time to focus on fitness and maths.<br /><br />Here is a few that I have considered as non-vital: art, textiles, history, science, geography, drama, religious&nbsp;education, music, design tech (workshop), business studies, finance.<br /><br /><div><br /></div>

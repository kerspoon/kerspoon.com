<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
I have an EEE-PC 1000HE running Ubuntu 9.04, and a BENQ 21" FP202W monitor. I would like to be able to have a dual screen set-up with both screens at max resolution. <br /><br />Looks like the new Ubuntu doesn't use /etc/X11/xorg.conf as the old versions did. In the old versions you could specify everything you wanted in xorg.conf and then would see the changes in the graphical program (System->Preferences->Display). My xorg is almost empty if I change the part that says Virtual to 2048 2048 I can have my larger resolutions, it does slow my PC down and I don't think it supports anything above 2048 but that's all I has to do. <br /><br />Easy, (after hours of searching forums)

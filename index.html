        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          I want to identify the most promising and rigorously analysed research in the world, and apply it as effectively as possible to make the world better for everyone. I am looking for varied and challenging roles that help me achieve that aim. My particular areas of interest are personal effectiveness, research, communication and education.
        </p><p>
          The start of my academic career was at the University of Bath in Psychology and Communication Engineering. Later, I specialised in Electrical Engineering in which I gained my B.Sc. and co-authored <a href="http://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&amp;user=uNAh3HIAAAAJ">several publications<a> on artificial intelligence. I moved on to achieve a Ph.D. in <a href="/assets/Thesis.pdf">Quantifying Risks in Renewable Power Generation</a>.
        </p><p>
          I returned to the world of communications when I became a cameraman and assisted on media training and communication skills events for a <a href="http://www.whitehart.co.uk">communication and multimedia company</a>. That became my preparation for leading the development of a <a href="http://5app.com">tech start-up</a> which included making technical decisions for product development as well as hiring new employees. My focus has evolved towards <a href="http://goalachievement.co.uk">teaching people</a> how to form positive habits, rapidly acquire new skills, and achieve their goals; presenting my ideas at Oxford University, Board Intelligence, The Effective Altruism Summit (USA), Stirling University, and The Centre for Applied Sciences (UK).

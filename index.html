        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
        I'm the Senior Developer for <a href="http://www.5app.co.uk">5app</a>. A software development company that has created a toolkit for making app development easy. We've got some smart tools that give you a sort of in zero-config in-browser IDE and a smart communication library that keeps your data between server and phone in sync. I'm mostly in charge of the handset native code and javascript.
        </p><p>
        Prior to that I have spent the last 8 years working part time for a <a href="http://www.whitehart.co.uk">communication and multimedia company</a>. I mainly did filming and editing, but I've done the odd bit of 3D work, graphics, authoring. I also help out at the media training and communication courses.
        </p><p>
        My studies started in a B.Sc. in Psychology and Communication Engineering and went through to my <a href="http://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&amp;user=uNAh3HIAAAAJ">Ph.D. in Renewable Electrical Power</a> (specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Programming Mathematical Models). So I have a great interest in both these areas.

        <h3>Résumé</h3>
        <p>As I work on such a variety of projects I have different résumés for my video and programming work. My programming work is probably best described through the <a title="Projects" href="/projects.html">projects</a> I have done. For the other work I have a short <a href="/assets/CV.pdf">CV</a> or an example of a <a title="Cover Letter" href="/assets/cover-letter.pdf">Cover Letter</a> for a job I recently applied to.</p>

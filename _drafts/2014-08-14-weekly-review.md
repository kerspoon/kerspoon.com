Every week I take about 30 mins review how my week has been and how I can do it better. It is all based around my ideas on [rapid skill acquisition ](#), basically you need a clear idea of a) what success looks like, b) what's been working or is moving you in the right direction, and c) what the next concrete action is.

Note that I also do this on a [monthly ](#) and [yearly ](#) basis. The idea being that each year I take check of the overall things that are important to me in life, each month I take some of those areas and think about how I could work on making them better in some way, and each week I take one of those ideas and try it out.

## What to work on

One of my most useful motivational tools is a [calendar of things I have accomplished ](#). In essence it is a monthly calendar where I write down what things I have done that day. For example it might say "climbing, anki, todo list, chat with Steve". This serves a a very useful reminder for working out how my past week has gone and gives me ideas of what things I could work on in the coming week.

Another tool I use is a list of goal ideas. I don't like having long to-do list - all the tasks that I'm realistically not going to get finished that week get sent to a list of potential tasks - merely ideas of things I could work on at a later date. This again serves as a useful reference of things might want to spend some time this week doing.

A similar rule applies to my email inbox - I like it almost completely empty. If it is not something I have to deal with for the next day (or longer) then I use [boomerang](#) to hide it from my inbox until a later date. What is left is the urgent or important tasks and I spend some time in my weekly review deciding whether it really is worth me working on them and if so how can I get them done sooner (If they are in my inbox for more than a day it is probably because I'm putting them off).

I can also refer to my monthly and yearly review which serves as handy reminders of what things I think are important for me to work on in general. One nice thing about having the monthly review is that the goals come already partly turned into something that is fairly achievable - but there may be some final tweaks before I set it as one of my weekly tasks.

**Rule: Keep your inbox and to-do list small**

## Training and Learning

Rather than setting these ideas as goals in a concrete authoritarian way I prefer to frame it as animal training. I want to train myself to work effectively on all the things that I think are important (rather than the things that are urgent or things that are easy or procrastinating), ideally (from the point of view of positive reinforcement training) this should be done through creating tasks where my desire to do the task is higher than the distractions. My meta-aim is to gradually learn methods that allow me to make successful changes in my life. It doesn't really matter if I fail to complete a task I have set myself as long as the next week I can come up with a strategy that is more likely to work.

**Rule: View all of this process as a learning procedure**

## Aims need to be turned into Objectives (goals need compiling)

If I come up with a task like "go running more often" then I know it will take some work to make sure I actually have the impetus to go running at some point. Merely having the goal written down will not make that happen. Here I like to make a distinction between two types of goals. Aims are the outcomes such as "be fitter". Objectives are the things that I will do to make that happen such as "go running", but even that can be broken down into what I will do to make sure that will happen. This can continue until I have something that I'm pretty sure will succeed. Mental Contrasting and Implementation Intentions (MCII) is a great way to make a goal more achievable - I don't use it every time but for tasks that I think will be tricky it is a very useful tool (and there are quite a lot of such tools out there - finding out which of them works for you is an incredibly worthwhile task).

**Rule: Goals need work to make them achievable**

## Step 1: Review The Past Week

Here the aim is to collect a few bullet points on how the week has been. I generally focus on three areas.

- Things that worked well - especially if they are related to anything in my yearly review. There are certainly going to be times when I happen to be progressing well on something that is important to me - by getting these situations to happen more regularly I get a free pass to working on what is important.

- Anything that cause a big change in my emotion - either positive or negative. A while ago there were a number of cases where I have been in a bad mood and couldn't fathom the reason. By noting down when these occurred I was able to see that it was straight after coming home from work, I decided to see it if was related to tiredness, being hungry or not something relating to the job itself. This led to the problem becoming much rarer.

- Things I have been putting off. This involves looking through my email inbox and my to-do list, really if anything is on there at this point in the week it is because I have been putting it off (or didn't value it as highly as every other thing I did during that week). If I know what I find aversive then I can put in deliberate effort to find ways to make it more enjoyable.

## Step 2: Review Past Goals

Here I copy last weeks goals and add a single line comment on how they went. The aim being to see if there is a better way of doing the task.

Some tasks are one off things that are either done or not. I sometimes note whether I did these at the date and time I actually planned to but generally I just write either "DONE" or "NOT".

For tasks and goals that are ongoing or should be done more than one I write down a little more. Firstly how many times I actually did the thing. If I'm trying to get something to be a habit but only doing it once a week ... well it's going to take a long time. Next I write if it is worth the effort often this is a simple yes or no. This leads to the final question which is what do I want to do with the goal - keep it as it is change it in some way or discard it.

## Step 3: Create Next Week's Goals

After reading through the various files I described above (monthly review, goal-ideas file, history calendar, email inbox, etc) I come up with a short list (under 7, ideally under 4) of items that I really want to get done this week - this is the most important part of the entire review - knowing exactly what things are important to work on. Then comes the next most important part, setting up the goal such that you have a good chance to achieve it. For this I generally use mental contrasting and implementation intentions (MCII) or, for tasks that I think I have a good chance of doing anyway I just set a date and time to work on it and make sure I know what the first step is. To do MCII simply do the following steps:

1. Vividly imagine your best (realistic) hopes that achieving this goal will lead to.
2. Contrast with the reality of things that stand in your way.
3. Repeat the above two steps one more time.
4. Work out a trigger for when to do the task; make it vivid, concrete and simple.
5. Work out what the first step is, make sure it doesn't involve any decisions.
6. Do the last two steps for the task itself as well as a couple of obstacles that you think
might occur

## Step 4: Review of Review

Finally I take a few seconds to note a single line on how the review itself went. This often results in me realizing I have skipped an important part of the review (normally the implementation intentions - which can be mentally taxing) and decided that before I finish the review I should go back and do it. The three things I normally note are: How long did it take me, am I happy that I did it justice, and occasionally how can I make this better.

## Example weekly review

Here is one weekly review in it's entirety that I did a number of years ago.

1. Review Past Week

- I tried to practice dancing and I had to stop because I found it mentally difficult. A change of subject and hearing an unrelated story straight after fixed my mood completely.
- Ceroc on Monday was good, bachata on Thursday was amazing!
- The boss and I are getting on better, keeping him in the loop is all he wanted. We still disagree strongly but it does not cause such an issue.
- I have felt happier after work.
- I lacked a clear plan in the last few days and really didn't do much work even though I kept a diary.
- my emails and todo list have been kept pretty much at 0 and I love that.

2. Review Past Goals

- when I get into work: do check-in, then email results to Boss (week trial) -- *check-in 3 times, emailed once, but kept in better contact by him calling me. keep the morning check in and writing it in diary.*
- when in difficult conversation, focus on win/win and disown ideas: *done maybe 3 times, it is an improvement and needs work, stick with it.*
- when I finish a block of work, start 10 min practice of touch typing: *done every day but irregularly, which is what I want. keep.*
- when I get in to work, write date and time in diary. *done every day. keep*
- on Monday in work: write an intro to my the MAM re-write. *done*
- message *friend name* about the summer party. *done*
- message people about pizza tomorrow. *done*
- update weekly review and monthly review template to match notes in monthly. *done*
- book weekender accom. *done*

3. Create Next Week's Goals

- in difficult conversations focus on win-win.
- in-work write check-in in diary.
- when finished work block, do keybr.
- notice when things go well with *friend name* and me.
- after this review, facebook *friend name* about contacting *friend name* again.
- after this review, call to Hire kilt.
- after this review, facebook *friend name* about teaching workshop.
- after this review, pay *friend name*.

4. Review of Review

- 8:55 to 9:15 = 0:20
- Much better format to not have to write lots in the first section.
- The monthly review is clearer which helps.
- I have pretty much nothing on my todo list. Hence a short but useful review.

## Summary

Every week I spend about 30 mins reviewing how my week has been and how I can do it better.

1. Review Past Week
 - read: last weekly review, calendar, notebook
 - make notes on: what went well, big mood changes, and things I have been putting things off.

2. Review Past Goals
 - how-often did I do it?, was it worth-it?, keep/change/discard

3. Create Next Week's Goals
 - read: last monthly review, last yearly review, goal-ideas file
 - on each goal: mental-contrasting, implementation intentions

4. Review of Review
 - how-long did it take?, am I happy-with-it?, how could it be better

Every year I take about 4 hours review how my year has been and think about the things I value. The aim is to come up with a list of areas that I want to work on. To help me in that task I split this into 9 categories:

+ Intellectual (books, subjects)
+ Health (diet, exercise, sleep)
+ Emotions (feel more/less of, more control)
+ Career (is the career path you are on leading you to a place you want to be)
+ Financial (are you happy with how much you spend, save, earn)
+ Social (people to spend more/less time around, what kind of people do you want to meet)
+ Fun (what do you want to do)
+ Personal (what character traits do you want to change)
+ Philanthropic (how do you want to help others, or help the world)

To start this process I spend a couple of hours reading through various files I have made and taking short notes on how I have been progressing.

- I start with my monthly reviews.
- I then go on to read some of the weekly reviews from the year trying to spot patterns such as things that made me happy or times when I wasn't procrastinating.
- Next up is the last 12 months of my [calendar of things I have accomplished ](#) (in essence it is a monthly calendar where I write down what things I have done that day). This is a good place to see if the values I said I had last year matched with what I actually did.
- Then the list of goal ideas. I like to start afresh each year and empty my list of goal ideas. If there are things I really want to work on I can always move them over later.
- Finally I look through last years review.

Hopefully by this point I have a good feel for what I actually did during the year.

Next I take a piece of paper and write down the

**TODO: I need to look through my notes on what I actually do here**
